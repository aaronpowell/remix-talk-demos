# Remix Demos

This repo contains the demos for my talk [**Remix, is it more React hype?**](https://www.aaron-powell.com/talks/remix-is-it-more-react-hype/).

Inside the `packages` folder you'll find the progressive demos, labels `01` - `06`, with `00` being the starting point for the interactive implementation demo.
